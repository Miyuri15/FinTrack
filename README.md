npx jest tests/unit/


Run Integration Tests
bash
npm run test:integration
npx jest tests/integration/


Run Security Tests (Using ZAP & Postman Proxy)
Security testing was conducted using OWASP ZAP with Postman proxy support to detect vulnerabilities. The following steps were performed:

1. Configure Postman Proxy: 
   - Set up Postman to route API requests through a proxy.
   - Used OWASP ZAP to capture and analyze API traffic.

2. Active Scan in ZAP:
   - Conducted an active scan on API endpoints to identify vulnerabilities.
   - Checked for SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws, and other security issues.

3. Generate Reports:
   - Security vulnerabilities were logged and documented using ZAP's reporting tool.

Since no automated security test script was created, this process was performed manually.

Run Performance Tests
Performance testing was conducted to evaluate the API‚Äôs ability to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
We used Artillery.io for load testing.
```bash
npm run test:performance
npx artillery run tests/performance/load-test.yml
```

Additional Notes
- Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the application.
- Environment variables must be configured properly before running tests.
- Security testing was conducted using manual ZAP scans.
- Performance testing results should be reviewed to analyze response times and load capacity.
